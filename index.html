    <h2 id="section-title">Random facts about cats in Cyprus</h2>
    <ul>
      <li class="right">The earliest known written record of cats on Cyprus refers to a story of Saint Helen of Constantinople sending two boatloads of cats to a monastery on the island from Egypt or Palestine in the 4th century A.D. to deal with an infestation of snakes.
      </li>
      <li class="left">The earliest archaeological evidence of the relationship between humans and cats can be found in Cyprus. It is a burial of a man and a kitten, which dates back to… 7500 BC!
      </li>
      <li class="right">Cats on Cyprus have been able to breed for centuries with comparatively little outside influence; this has resulted in a distinct, locally adapted variety of cat which appears to have developed as a feral population in the inner highlands, though is found throughout the island in modern times.
      </li>
      <li class="left">There are a lot of sanctuaries for cats in Cyprus. However, despite that there are still a lot of cats roaming every corner of the island from beaches to mountains and every site in between. As a tourist you can find cats around most hotels and restaurants.
      </li>
      <li class="right">Information about the Cyprus cat landrace can be found on it's <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyprus_cat">Wikipedia</a> page where some of the facts on this page originate from.
      </li>
      <li class="left">You can adopt a cat when visiting Cyprus from sanctuaries such as <a target="_blank" href="https://www.malcolmcat.org/category/cats-needing-homes/">Malcolm Cat Protection Society</a> or right of the street. You are guranteed a companion for life which won't change your lifestyle <i>*assides from making you worship them</i>.
